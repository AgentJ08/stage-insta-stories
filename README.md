This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Application Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentJ08/stage-insta-stories.git
cd stage-insta-stories
npm install
```

## Running The Application

```
The application would start running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
To get the mobile view, open developer tools of the browser and select the mobile dimensions.

## Running The Tests

## Design Choices
- Using two 1D arrays for storing views status, instead of a 2D array.

## Assumptions I Made
- The loggedin user has atleast one story uploaded.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel.
